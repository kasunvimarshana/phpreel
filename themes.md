# Introduction
phpReel introduces the concept of themes as a way of creating your custom designs while at the same time not requiring extensive programming knowledge.

The theme is nothing more than a collection of folders and files that together will change the way your application will render to the end-user. To ease your development process, phpReel created components. These are similar to a function that you can call to bring content from phpReel to your HTML5 template. You will learn more about components later in this documentation.

# Components
As we previously stated, components are basic functions that help you link phpReel to your HTML5 template (stuff like embedding a video, linking CSS or js files, and so on). In this section we will discuss in detail everything about these components, what is their purpose, and how you can use them to create your themes.
